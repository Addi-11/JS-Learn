JS-Learn is a collection of small javascript projects meant for people who are new to the language.

JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted *easy-to-learn* programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles.

### Dependencies
JavaScript engines are embedded in many other types of host software, including server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web programs such as word processors and PDF software, and in runtime environments that make JavaScript available for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.

Thus **no dependencies** are required.
